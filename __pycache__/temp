================ ANSWER ================

To calculate the **total cloud cost**, use the `cost` table. Specifically:

- **Field to sum:** `usd` (represents cloud cost in USD).
- You may also consider `nok` (cost in NOK) if required for regional insights.

For analysis:
- You can use the `calendar` table for time-based segmentation (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly totals).
- Optionally, use the `category` and `sub_category` columns in the `cost` table for cost breakdowns.

This analysis can be visualized in Power BI with a total sum measure or a time-series report using `usd` or `nok`.
