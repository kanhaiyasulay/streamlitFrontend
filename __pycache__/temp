Thanks for moving the model to the test workspace.

Since the PowerBI-COE service principal already has access, could you please share the authentication details for that App Registration so I can generate the OAuth token from the code?

Specifically, I need:

Client ID (Application ID)

Client Secret (or a new secret if one is not available)

Tenant ID confirmation (for completeness)

I will use these to authenticate against the Fabric MCP endpoint and test connectivity to the provided WorkspaceId/DatasetId.

Thanks!
