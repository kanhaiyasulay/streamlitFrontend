Hi Guys,
    We had a chat with GSS-IT today and they have agreed on enabling MCP servers to connect to the semantic model.
We have been asked though to test it first on non premium capacity workspace.

I have moved the model to our test workspace. You can find it here: Power BI

WorkspaceId: f3dbf6fa-62fd-416b-a489-0837030755b5
DatasetId: 017cc367-1faf-4fcf-ac41-122a6a665e6d

The PowerBI-COE service principal have already access to that workspace as a Contributor.
