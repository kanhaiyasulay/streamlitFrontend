✔️ The 4 Most Common Reasons (and yours is 100% one of these)
🔴 1️⃣ Service Principal NOT Added to Workspace (Most Likely)

Even if Admin says “you have access” —
Service Principal must be added explicitly.

👉 In Fabric / Power BI:

Workspace → Manage Access → Add →
Add your App Registration Name
Give it Contributor or Admin (Viewer is NOT enough)

Service Principals do NOT inherit user permissions.

🔴 2️⃣ Tenant Setting Not Enabled for Service Principals

Admin must enable:

Allow service principals to use Power BI APIs

AND must allow it for the security group containing your App.

If this is off → MCP connects but returns [].

🔴 3️⃣ Dataset Is NOT In That Workspace

This happens when:

Report copied to another workspace

Dataset lives in different workspace than you think

You're using workspace from URL, not dataset workspace

You MUST confirm:

Dataset bf47a12c-18e3-49b3-ad4d-8f90f282928c
exists inside:

Workspace 816f9fea-3392-4ca9-8b02-4343d9e463b9

🔴 4️⃣ Dataset Is Using Live Connection / Not a Fabric Semantic Model

MCP ONLY works with:

✔ Fabric Semantic Models
✔ Imported models
✔ Direct Lake

It does NOT work with:

Live connection to SSAS

External models

Thin reports




🔎 Let’s Confirm Which Case This Is (Do This Quick Check)

Ask your admin (or check yourself if you can):

✔ Open Workspace → Settings → Advanced

Confirm:

Is this a Fabric workspace?

Is the dataset listed under Semantic Models (not just Reports)?





✅ So Where We Are Right Now

Your pipeline is correct.
Auth is correct.
MCP usage is correct.

The blocker is purely:

Fabric Security Context ≠ Dataset Ownership Context

This is extremely common when first using MCP.

👉 Next Step

Before changing code again, confirm just one thing:

Can you see that App Registration listed inside Workspace → Manage Access?

If not → that's the issue.
