The schema of the semantic model or tables has been retrieved successfully! However, it’s quite detailed. Could you clarify which specific table or part of the schema you are interested in?

Ask FinOps question: i want to see the cost table schema

📊 Answer:

I am unable to retrieve the semantic model schema at this time. There may be an issue with the connectivity or authorization to access the dataset. Please verify if access permissions to the dataset are set correctly, or try again later.
