Ask FinOps question: show me schema of cost table

📊 Answer:

I'm unable to retrieve the schema for the "cost" table at the moment due to a technical issue. If there's a specific question or detail you're looking for, such as measures, columns, or aggregations related to cost, let me know, and I can assist using other methods!
